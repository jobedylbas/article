IN DARKNESS:
A Native African VOICE calls out in SONG.
FADE IN:
Dawn. The sun slowly rises over an African plain - full, brilliant.
Native African VOICES respond in SONG. The SOLO VOICE continues, joined by
the group.
CLOSE ON:
ANIMALS - alert to the sound: a RHINO, TOPEES, MEERCATS, a CHEETAH, several
MARABOU STORKS. Another marabou stork enters frame. Intro SONG: "THE CIRCLE
OF LIFE"
The stork takes wing.
EXT. VICTORIA FALLS
The rising sun lights the cascading water. The marabou storks fly across
frame.
EXT. PLAIN WITH KILIMANJARO IN B.G.
ELEPHANTS walk along through the morning mist.
AERIAL SHOT - A RIVER
Flocks of airborne FLAMINGOS cast «shadows on the meandering waterway,
below.
GAZELLES leap and run across a grassy plain.
EXT. A HILL
A MOTHER GIRAFFE crests the hill, followed by her baby, as the song lyric
begins:
VOICE:
singing
FROM THE DAY WE ARRIVE ON THE PLANET
AND BLINKING STEP INTO THE SUN THERE'S MORE TO SEE THAN CAN EVER BE
MORE TO DO THAN CAN EVER BE DONE
The mother and child giraffes cross frame and reach a crest that overlooks
a huge migration of animals. They lope down the hill to join them. We HOLD
ON:
A TREE BRANCH where ants carrying leaves march across. RACK FOCUS to
reveal:
ZEBRAS below, trotting in the same direction as the rest of the herds.
DOWN SHOT - GUINEA FOWL
waddle toward us, as dust reveals:
A HUGE ELEPHANT who crests an incline and lumbers toward us. The guinea
fowl scamper ahead. One is almost stepped on by the elephant's huge hoof.
EXT. A STREAM
reflecting the morning sun. The reflection is shattered by ZEBRA who leap
Page 2/100
into the water and cross, causing an explosion of shimmering droplets. In
the b.g., AN ELEPHANT with birds perched on its head and tusks gives them
safe passage across the stream. PAN to see'the animals getting out of the
stream and joining a SCREENFUL of animals, all walking in the same
direction.
VOICE:
THERE'S FAR TOO MUCH TO TAKE IN HERE MORE TO FIND THAN EVER BE FOUND BUT
THE SUN ROUTING HIGH THROUGH THE SAPPHIRE SKY KEEPS GREAT AND SMALL ON THE
ENDLESS ROUND
The light changes. PAN to REVEAL:
EXT. PRIDE ROCK - CONTINUOUS
An impressive mountain: with many plateaus, levels and textures. It stands
castle-like in the center of the Pride lands.
VOICE:
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE AND IT MOVES US ALL THROUGH DESPAIR AND HOPE
THROUGH FAITH AND LOVE ON A PATH UNWINDING TILL WE FIND OUR PLACE IN THE
CIRCLE THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
AERIAL SHOT - CONTINUOUS
WE TRACK in with a horn bill (ZAZU) who flies over the gathered animals and
ANGLES up, up, up to the promontory.
He lands and bows regally to an 0. S. character. He gestures with his wing,
indicating that all is ready and reverently backs away.
ANGLE - MUFASA
The rising sun lights this regal, commanding lion (MUFASA) — who
acknowledges Zazu with a warn nod.
REVERSE ANGLE:
Below, the animals are collected in a natural amphitheater.
WITH MUFASA:
Surveying the situation.
WITH THE ANIMALS
Gourds and on the top of a walking stick make their way through the crowd.
An old baboon (RAFIKI) who carries the walking stick, hobbles out from the
crowd, toward Pride Rock. There is mystery and humor to this old fellow as
he ambles forward and scales the cliff.
EXT. EDGE OF PLATEAU - ABOVE
Raflki's head pops up. He ambles to a standing position, goes right to
Mufasa and gives him a hug. Mufasa beans. These guys obviously go way back.
They turn and look at:
A LIONESS (SARABI) who has her newborn cub (SIMBA) nestled at her feet.
Page 3/100
FULL SHOT:
Mufasa lovingly nuzzles Sarabi. Then he nuzzles the little cub.
MUSIC UNDER:
ANGLE - THE CUB
Rafiki looks at him. He shakes a gourds on his walking stick over Simba and
they RATTLE. He cracks a gourd open and smears some goo on the little-guy's
forehead. He takes a handful of dirt and sprinkles it over Simba. Simba
SNEEZES. Mufasa and Sarahi, doting parents, think this is adorable.
RAFIKI ever-so-carefully lifts Simba and carries him to the promontory of
Pride Rock. He holds the cub up for all to see.
The animals react with glee: ELEPHANTS trumpet; MONKEYS applaud and do
somersaults; ZEBRAS stomp.
THE SKY:
A shaft of sunlight shines down through the clouds on the future king.
THE ANIMALS bow and genuflect grandly.
SUMMIT OF PRIDE ROCK
Rafiki holds the cub high. Mufasa and Sarabi watch.
VOICE:
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
AND IT MOVES US ALL
THROUGH DESPAIR AND HOPE THROUGH FAITH AND LOVE
ON A PATH UNWINDING
TILL WE FIND OUR PLACE
IN THE CIRCLE:
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
MUSIC OUT.

SEQ. 1.2 (SCAR, ZAZU, MUFASA)
FADE IN:
EXT. A ROCK SURFACE - A SHORT TIME LATER
A chameleon blends in with its terrain. Its eyes shift. It walks away. PAN
DOWN the rock to reveal a shadow then a dark crevice.
DARKNESS:
Two little eyes dart erratically across FRAME. As b.g. becomes lighter, we
realize that the eyes belong to a FIELD MOUSE.
EXT. SHADE TREE AREA - CONTINUOUS
As the field mouse scarpers, a huge lion paw THUDS into frame and traps the
Page 4/100
mouse in its jail-like claws. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
SCAR, a thin, angular lion with an attitude problem. He gingerly lifts the
mouse by its tail and dangles it over his gaping mouth. Rather than eat the
mouse. Scar rolls it through his paw the way a gambler rolls a coin.
SCAR:
Life's not fair. Yes -- You see, I shall never be king. And you shall never
see another day. Adieu.
As Scar is about to eat the mouse, he HEARS:
ZAZU (O.S.)
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
SCAR:
Oh, Zazu. What do you want?
REVEAL Zazu, the horn bill we net in the opening scene. Zazu blends regal
with ironic edge. He reveres his boss (King Mufasa) and disdains anyone he
perceives to be a low-life cretin -- which is pretty much everybody but the
King.
ZAZU:
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa's on his way. And you'd better have a
good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning.
The little mouse escapes to freedom.
SCAR:
mock sad
Now look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.
ZAZU:
You'll lose more than that when the king gets through with you. He's as mad
as a hippo with a hernia.
Scar, licking his chops, advances on Zazu who backs away.
SCAR:
Ooooo. I quiver with fear.
ZAZU:
Now, Scar -- Don't look at me that way.
Scar continues stalking.
ZAZU:
Help!
Scar catches Zazu in his mouth. And CHOMPS his teeth shut. Mufasa enters,
having witnessed what Scar just did.
Page 5/100
MUFASA:
admonishing
Scar!
Scar, surprised, and with a bird bulge in his mouth:
SCAR:
Hmmm?
With that, Zazu's beak pokes out from Scar's lips. It looks like the
mouth-within-a-mouth in "Alien."
ZAZU'S BEAK
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.
MUFASA:
to a disobedient puppy
Drop him!
SCAR:
releasing Zazu
Plegh!
Zazu tumbles to the ground and shakes off.
SCAR:
to Mufasa
Why if it isn't my big brother, descending from on high to mingle among the
commoners.
MUFASA:
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
genuine
Is anything wrong?
SCAR:
insincere
That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful. Must have slipped my mind.
ZAZU:
Yes, well as slippery as your mind is, as the king's brother, you should
have been first in line.
Scar nips at Zazu, who evades him.
SCAR:
I was first in line until the little hairball was born.
Page 6/100
MUFASA:
That hairball is my son and your future king.
SCAR:
I shall practice my curtsy.
Scar abruptly turns to walk away. Mufasa calls after him:
MUFASA:
Don't turn your back on me, Scar!
Scar reels back around.
SCAR:
Oh, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.
MUFASA:
Is that a challenge?
Zazu ducks behind a rock.
SCAR:
pointed
Temper-temper.
butter wouldn't melt
A challenge? Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.
Zazu hops forward.
ZAZU:
Pity.
a beat
Why not?
SCAR:
Scar slinks away. Zazu and Mufasa watch him leave.
ZAZU:
There's one in every family, sire. Two in nine, actually. And they always
manage to ruin special occasions.
As they walk off:
MUFASA:
What an I going to do with him?
ZAZU:
Page 7/100
MUFASA:
good idea
Zazu!
ZAZU:
And just think. Whenever he gets dirty, you can take him out and beat him.

SEQ. 3:
TIME PASSAGE MONTAGE
EXT. AN ACACIA TREE - DAY
Glimmering in the sunlight then darkening as the sky clouds over. It starts
to rain.
A FLAT PLAIN rain drenches the land. LIGHTNING FLASHES.
DISTANT MOUNTAINS the storm moves over the hills and plains, casting
shadows.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PRIDE ROCK - PRE-DAWN - MONTHS LATER
In the distance, Pride Rock in its pre-dawn splendor. Simba, now a
full-grown cub, trots into:
INT. ROYAL CAVE — CONTINUOUS
SFX:
Simba, barely able to contain his excitement, bounds over to his sleeping
parents, bumping affectionately against his father.
SIMBA:
Hey, Dad. Wake up! Dad!
Mufasa doesn't respond. Simba presses on, nudging his Dad. He tugs on
Mufasa's ear and falls off, landing with an "Ooff!"
SIMBA:
Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad-Dad --
SARABI:
Your son is awake.
MUFASA:
Before sunrise, he's your son.
Simba pulls on Mufasa's tail and gets gently swatted out of frame. He runs
in and head butts Mufasa:
Page 8/100
SIMBA:
You promised!
Mufasa pops open one eye.
MUFASA:
Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up.
SIMBA:
All-right!
SARABI:
Hon-ey --
She nudges him HARD. His eyes pop open.
MUFASA:
Okay! Okay!
PRIDE ROCK LONG SHOT - MINUTES LATER
Simba exits the cave, followed by his parents. He trots ahead then runs
back to his mother. Sarabi gently nuzzles him and gives him a little push
on his way.
Sarabi watches proudly as Mufasa and Simba head up Pride Rock.
EXT. PRIDE ROCK - CONTINUOUS
Mufasa and Simba look out over the Pride lands as the sun crests the far
horizon, shooting yellow beams across the vast expanse.
MUFASA:
Simba, look:
Simba's eyes follow the horizon and grow wide.
SIMBA:
Wow.
As Simba moves around the plateau to survey his kingdom, we see the vistas
he sees.
MUFASA (V.O)
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day the sun will
set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
SIMBA:
And this will all be mine?
MUFASA:
Everything.
Page 9/100
SIMBA:
in awe
Everything the light touches,
scanning horizon
What about that shadowy place?
MUFASA:
That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.
SIMBA:
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.
MUFASA:
Mufasa exits the shot. Simba follows.
SIMBA:
wide-eyed
There's more?
MUFASA:
cautionary
Well, Simba --
PRIDE ROCK - VISTA SHOTS
Mufasa and Simba are dots on the horizon. They look out at the land in
harmony. Antelope leap and move along.
WITH SIMBA AND MUFASA
Simba is amazed and impressed by all that he sees around him.
MUFASA (V.O.)
Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king you need
to understand that balance and respect all the creatures -- from the
crawling ant, to the leaping antelope.
SIMBA:
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?
MUFASA:
Yes, Simba. But let me explain.
MUFASA:
then:
When we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass.
Page 10/100
And so we're all connected in the great Circle of Life.
Simba considers this. Zazu flaps in and lands on a nearby rock.
SEQ. 3.1 (POUNCING)
ZAZU:
Good morning, Sire!
MUFASA:
Good morning, Zazu.
ZAZU:
Checking in with the morning report.
MUFASA:
Fire away!
Mufasa nods to Zazu to begin. Simba couldn't care less; he eyes a passing
butterfly and lopes after it.
ZAZU:
The buzz from the bees is that, well -- the leopards are in a bit of a spot
--
Simba pounces toward the butterfly and misses. Mufasa notices, but Zazu
drones on.
MUFASA:
to Zazu
Oh, really?
ZAZU (O.S.)
The baboons are going ape. Of course.
Mufasa notices Simba's leap for the insect and miss.
MUFASA:
whispering
What are you doing, son?
SIMBA:
Pouncing.
MUFASA:
Let an old pro show you how it's done.
ZAZU (O.S.)
The tick birds were picking on the elephants. I told the elephants to
forget it, but they can't.
Page 11/100
MUFASA:
Zazu, would you turn around?
ZAZU:
turning around
Yes, Sire.

The cheetahs are hard up, but as I always say --
MUFASA:
whispering, to Simba
Stay low to the ground.
ZAZU:
-- Cheetahs never prosper.
SIMBA:
to himself
Okay, stay low to the ground. Right, yeah.
ZAZU:
Uh -- What's going on?
MUFASA:
A pouncing lesson.
ZAZU:
auto pilot
Oh. Very good. Pouncing!
realizing
Pouncing? Oh, no, Sire. You can't be serious!
Mufasa gestures to Zazu to turn back around. While Zazu prattles on, Mufasa
instructs his son:
ZAZU:
grumbling
This is so humiliating.
MUFASA:
whispering to Simba
Try not to make a sound.
Simba makes his way stealthily toward Zazu.
ZAZU:
Page 12/100
What are you telling him, Mufasa? Mufasa? -- Simba?
Simba flies through the air and hits his target.
ZAZU:
Aaaaaakkk!
Mufasa laughs. Zazu dusts himself off.
MUFASA:
Ha-ha-ha That's very good!
A HOLE pops up from a hole in the ground.
MOLE:
Zazu!
ZAZU:
Yes?
MOLE:
News from the underground!
He whispers "BZZZ-BZZZ-BZZZ" in Zazu's ear.
MUFASA:
to Simba
Now next time --
ZAZU:
to Mufasa!
Sire, Hyenas! In the Pride lands!
MUFASA:
exiting
Zazu, take Simba home.
SIMBA:
Aw, Dad, can't I come?
MUFASA:
No, son.
Mufasa runs off.
WITH SIMBA AND ZAZU
SIMBA:
I never get to go anywhere.
Page 13/100
ZAZU:
Oh, Young Master, one day you will be king. Then you can do whatever you
want.
SIMBA:
That's not what my dad told me.
ZAZU:
Well, let old Zazu set you straight. You're going to have it all. You'll be
-- Head Honcho! Top Banana! The Grahhhhnd Fromage --
SIMBA:
pumped up
All-right!
SEQ. 4 (SIMBA/SCAR)
EXT. SCAR'S SUNNING AREA - MINUTES LATER
Scar walks along a cliff's edge. He kicks a small rock off.
Simba, pumped up by Zazu's speech, runs into frame.
SIMBA:
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?
SCAR:
I despise guessing games.
SIMBA:
undaunted
I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock!
SCAR:
underwhelmed
Oh goodie.
SIMBA:
My Dad just showed me the whole kingdom! And I'm gonna rule it all!
SCAR:
Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know.
Scar flops down and rolls away from Simba. But the undaunted cub comes back
for more.
SIMBA:
Hey, Uncle Scar, when I'm king, what'll that make you?
Page 14/100
SCAR:
A monkey's uncle.
SIMBA:
laughing
You're so weird.
SCAR:
You have no idea.

So your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?
SIMBA:
Everything!
SCAR:
He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border?
SIMBA:
Well, no.
miffed
He said I can't go there.
SCAR:
And he's absolutely right. It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest of
lions go there.
SIMBA:
defensive
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?
SCAR:
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.
SIMBA:
Why not?
Scar puts his massive paw gently on Simba's head.
SCAR:
Simba, Simba. I'm only looking out for the well-being of my favorite
nephew.
Simba squirms free.
SIMBA:
Page 15/100
Yeah, right. I'm your only nephew.
SCAR:

Oops.
SIMBA:
An elephant what?
awed
Whoa!
SCAR:
Scar hugs Simba tight.
SIMBA:
No problem.
SCAR:
There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun.
Scar gives Simba a little boot to start him on his way. Then he calls to
Simba:
SCAR:
And remember:
SEQ. 4.1 (SIMBA/NALA)
EXT. A SHELTERED AREA OF PRIDE ROCK - MINUTES LATER
Lionesses lounge in the shade. Sarabi is nearby on a small rock. We find a
cute little cub, NALA, being given a bath (a cat kind of bath) by her mom,
SARAFINA. Nala is not enjoying the experience as her mother's tongue more
or less rearranges her face.
Simba trots in.
SIMBA:
Hey, Nala!
NALA:
flatly
Hi, Simba.
SIMBA:
Come on! I just heard about this great place!
Page 16/100
NALA:
I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.
SARABI (O.S.)
And it's tine for yours.
Sarabi picks up Simba by the scruff and lifts him up to the ledge she is
on. She starts to lick/bathe him. He protests.
SIMBA:
Mo-om!
He tries to wriggle free.
SARABI:
Would you hold still?
SIMBA:
Mot, you're messing up my mane!
Sarabi continues to bathe him, cat-style. He reacts.
SIMBA:
Eww -- Yuck!
He wriggles free and falls off to the ground below. He stands up and gives
himself a quick clean-up once-over, finishing up with his armpits.
SIMBA:
Okay, okay. I'm clean.
then
Can we go now?
NALA:
Where are we going, anyway? It better not be any place lane.
SIMBA:
No, it's really cool.
SARABI:
So where is this "really cool" place?
SIMBA:
Oh --
lying
around the waterhole.
NALA:
Page 17/100
unimpressed
The waterhole? What's so great about the waterhole--?
Trying to stake her take the bait.
SIMBA:
thru teeth
I'll show you when we get there.
NALA:
getting it
Ohhhh.
to Sarafina
Mon, can I go?
Sarafina looks to Sarabi for the verdict.
SARAFINA:
I don't know. Sarabi, what do you think?
SARABI:
Well --
SIMBA/NALA
thru cheesy grins
Pleeeez?
SARABI:
It's alright with me --
Simba and Nala sake a break for it.
SARABI:
As long Zazu goes with you.
Simba and Nala freeze in their tracks, crestfallen.
SIMBA:
Not Zazu.
DISSOLVE TO:
SEQ. 4.2 ("CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING")
EXT. A PLAIN - A SHORT TIME LATER
Zazu flaps on ahead of the two cubs, calling back:
ZAZU:
Step lively! The sooner we get to the waterhole, the sooner we can leave!
WITH SIMBA AND NALA
Page 18/100
NALA:
So where're we really goin'?
SIMBA:
on the Q.T.
An elephant graveyard.
NALA:
Wow!
SIMBA:
Shhh --
indicating
Zazu --
NALA:
Right. How're we gonna ditch the dodo?
Simba raises an eyebrow, then grins and leans in to huddle. We hear the
sounds of their conspiratorial WHISPERING:
Zazu sees them tete-a-tete and flies to them.
ZAZU:
Just look at you two! Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah!
Your parents will be thrilled. What with your being betrothed and all.
SIMBA:
Be-what?
ZAZU:
You and Nala are betrothed! Intended! Affianced!
Simba and Nala look at each other, shrugging a "Huh?"
NALA:
Meaning--?
ZAZU:
One day you two are going to be married!
SIMBA:
I'm gonna marry her?
ZAZU:
No -- me. Yes "her." you chuckle headed little oik.
Page 19/100
SIMBA:
Yuck!
NALA:
Eeuwww!
SIMBA:
I can't marry her. She's my friend.
NALA:
Yeah. It'd be too weird.
SIMBA:
Yeah. Forget it. We don't have to get married if we don't want to.
to Nala
Deal?
NALA:
Deal!
ZAZU:
Sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. It's a
tradition going back generations.
SIMBA:
Well, when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to do.
ZAZU:
Not so long as I'm around.
SIMBA:
In that case, you're fired.
ZAZU:
Nice try. But only the king can do that.
NALA:
Well, he's the future king.
SIMBA:
So you have to do what I tell you!
ZAZU:
Not yet, don't, you puny puff of pre-pubescent fuzz. And with an attitude
Page 20/100
like that, I'm afraid you will be a pretty pathetic king, indeed!
SIMBA:
Not the way I see it!
SONG:
Simba pounces Zazu playfully:
SIMBA:
I'M GONNA BE A MIGHTY KING SO ENEMIES BEWARE!
Zazu jumps backwards up onto a log and falls into a knot-hole.
ZAZU:
I'VE NEVER SEEN A KING OF BEASTS WITH QUITE SO LITTLE HAIR
Zazu plucks a hair from Simba's nonexistent mane
Simba's head pops through a leafy bush
SIMBA:
He ROARS in Zazu's face, in the process, blowing/spitting in Zazu's eye.
Zazu grabs for‘something to blow his nose in, unaware he's tugged an
elephant's ear:
ZAZU:
THUS FAR A RATHER UNINSPIRING THING
The elephant uses his trunk like a golf club and knocks Zazu out of frame.
He bounces across a stream, like a skipping stone. A reflection of
flamingos shatters and the birds burst into flight.
Simba and Nala race in.
SIMBA:
OH I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!
Zazu wades through, holding up his feathers like and old aunt holding up
her skirt at the beach.
ZAZU:
talking
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think I'n going to
stand by while you run around like a snot-nosed --
Simba and Nala trade off Baking faces behind Zazu's back when Zazu turns to
look at one, the other is staking the rude face. He finally catches them in
the act. They run circles around the old bird and leave him behind in a
puddle.

That's definitely out -
Zazu ducks to avoid an ostrich running through frame. Simba and Nala ride
ostriches that run away from Zazu.
He flies off, reaching the ostrich-riding cubs, and while flying backwards,
talks in their face:
ZAZU:
I THINK IT'S TIME THAT YOU AND I ARRANGED A HEART TO HEART
He CRASHES into a rhino rump and is flattened. The kids race by:
NALA:
KINGS DON'T NEED ADVICE FROM LITTLE HORN BILLS FOR A START.
Zazu falls to the ground and sits on a little perch unaware that he is
floating on a log down a stream, headed for a waterfall:
ZAZU:
IF THIS IS WHERE THE MONARCHY IS HEADED, COUNT ME OUT OF SERVICE, OUT OF
AFRICA, I WOULDN'T HANG ABOUT
Zazu disappears over the waterfall. He flies back up, irked:
ZAZU:
THIS CHILD IS GETTING WILDLY OUT OF WING
Zebra stripes fill the screen.
SIMBA:
OH I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!
Simba and Nala are saluted by two lines of Zebras. Zazu cones flapping
after them, and the Zebras and trap him between their legs.
Simba and Nala zip in and out of animals' legs. Zazu tries to catch then.
Page 22/100
Their heads pop in and out from behind legs.
Simba stands on a giraffe's head. He orders the animals. They obey. Zazu
gets caught underfoot.
SIMBA:
singing
EVERYBODY LOOK LEFT -
EVERYBODY LOOK RIGHT
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK I'M --
ZAZU:
screaming
Aaaaaaa...eek
Oooooo...Ow
Giraffes stand in a semi-circle. Simba steps from head to head like he's
moving across stepping stones.
Now it's a cacophony of animal movement, all building African "Bushy"
Berkley style until Zazu gets caught between two animals' rear ends.
SIMBA:
singing
STANDING IN THE SPOTLIGHT
ZAZU:
screaming
Not yet!
Simba whispers to a hippo, who whispers to a giraffe, who whispers to a
monkey:
SIMBA:
Ditch the Dodo.
Zazu gets nabbed by the monkeys, and take him up into a tree.
Alligators open their mouths, revealing the birds inside are singing.
ANIMAL CHORUS:
LET EVERY CREATURE GO FOR BROKE AND SING LET'S HEAR IT IN THE HERD AND ON
THE WING IT'S GONNA BE KING SIMBA'S FINEST FLING
Giraffes toss Simba and Nala into the air "Beach Blanket Bingo"-style.
Zazu is being held captive by a monkey family.
Simba and Nala are at the top of a '40s-style sculptured stack of animals.
Poor Zazu is supporting the whole mass. He can't balance any longer. The
sculpture starts to wabble, sending Simba and Nala flying.
SIMBA:
Page 23/100
OH I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING’
Finally free of Zazu, Simba and Nala make their break for it, as the tower
of animals tumbles.
SIMBA:
OH I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING!
All that remains is one very plump rhino. From below it WE HEAR:
ZAZU (V.O.)
I beg your pardon, Madam. Get off!
meekly
Simba? Nala?
SEQ. 5 (HYENA CHASE)
EXT. TOP OF A RIDGE - DAY
Simba and Nala run in LAUGHING at their success. They are jubilant.
SIMBA:
All-right! It worked!
NALA:
We lost him!
They "High Five" each other.
SIMBA:
I am a genius!
NALA:
Hey, genius -- it was my idea!
SIMBA:
Yeah, but I fulled it off!
NALA:
With me.
SIMBA:
Oh yeah?!
Simba playfully leaps for Nala and they tussle. She flips him. He lands
with a THUD! on his back and tries to get up, but Nala holds him there a
beat.
NALA:
Pinned ya!
SIMBA:
Page 24/100
Hey, let me up!
She does. He tries to flip her. She flips him again and they tumble down
the hill until --
EXT. ELEPHANT GRAVEYARD - CONTINUOUS
Nala lands on top of Simba.
NALA:
Pinned ya again!
They are suddenly interrupted by GEOTHERMIC STEAM PLUMES.
BOTH:
Gasp!
The steam clears, revealing:
AN ELEPHANT SKULL huge, terrifying. Simba and Nala both let out GASPS of
joy.
BOTH:
Whoooa!
SIMBA:
This is it! We made it!
NALA:
impressed
Wow! It's really creepy.
SIMBA:
Yeah. Isn't it great?!
NALA:
conspiratorial
We could get in big trouble.
SIMBA:
gleeful
I know.
NALA:
I wonder if its brains are still in there.
SIMBA:
C'mon, let's go check it out.
Simba is about to climb in one of the eye sockets. Zazu swoops in to chide:
Page 25/100
ZAZU:
SIMBA:
Oh, man --
ZAZU:
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.
SIMBA:
Look. Banana-Beak is scared!
ZAZU:
It's Mister Banana-Beak to you, Fuzzy.
sternly
And right now we are all in very real danger.
SIMBA:
bravado
Danger? Ha! I walk on the wild side. I laugh in the face of danger.
swagger
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
From inside the skull (and much louder), hideous HYENA LAUGHING follows
rapid-fire:
HYENA VOICES:
HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!!!
Simba, Nala and Zazu react to the sound then the sight of THREE HYENAS
slinking oozily out of the skull's eyes: BANZAI, a male hyena; SHENZI, a
female hyena; and a third hyena, ED — who doesn't speak but just LAUGHS.
(He's the Harpo of hyenas) They are three punks who get tripped up in their
own laughs. They slink around the cubs.
SHENZI:
Well, well, well, Banzai. What have we got here?
BANZAI:
Hmmm -- I don't know, Shenzi. What do you think, Ed?
Ed LAUGHS his signature laugh.
ED:
Hee-hee-hee.
BANZAI:
Page 26/100
Just what I was thinkin'. trespassers. A trio of trespassers.
ZAZU:
Zazu starts to fly, to lead the cubs to safety, but Shenzi slaps at Zazu's
tail feathers, pinning him to the ground.
SHENZI:
Whoa-whoa -- Wait, wait, wait. We ain't been properly introduced.
Freeing his tail feathers:
ZAZU:
proudly
I, madam, am the king's majordomo.
SHENZI:
Whoo-weee! A Major Dumbo!
BANZAI:
circling Simba
And that would make you --
SIMBA:
puffed up
The future king.
Royally mocking him:
BANZAI/SHENZI
Oooooo -- ooooo -- king!
SHENZI:
Then I guess we have to give you the royal treatment!
SIMBA:
Puh. You can't do anything to me.
ZAZU:
Er -- technically, they can. We are on their land.
SIMBA:
to Zazu
But they sneak onto our land all the time!
SIMBA:
to hyenas
Page 27/100
My dad told me about you. You're nothing but slobbering, mangy, stupid
poachers!
ZAZU:
whispering
Ix-nay on the oopid-stay.
BANZAI:
Hey! Who you callin' "oopid-stay"?
ZAZU:
Oh, my-my-my. Look at the sun. Time to go.
The hyenas block Zazu, Nala and Simba, then circle, licking their chops.
SHENZI:
suddenly folksy
What's the hurry? We'd love you to stick around for dinner.
BANZAI:
Yeah. We could have whatever's "lion" around.
amused
Get it? Lion around!
laughing
Heh-heh-heh.
ED:
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
BANZAI:
Oh, man! I don't know when the last tine was I had lion cubs!
Banzai grabs Simba's tail, Ed goes to bite it, but Simba slaps him away.
SIMBA:
Hey!
SHENZI:
Wait-wait-wait! I'm having the lion cubs.
While the hyenas are wrapped up in their argument, Simba, Nala and Zazu
sneak away, unnoticed.
BANZAI:
You will not. You can have the bird.
Ed notices the exit and frantically tries to get Banzai and Shenzi's
attention.
Page 28/100
SHENZI:
Don't you give me the bird!
BANZAI:
Alright-alright! We'll split the bird. But I get the wings.
SHENZI:
Oh, sure. And I get stuck with the bill.
Ed is between them, acting out the exit of Simba et al, vocalizing like a
dog whimpering.
ED:
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uhBANZAI:
Okay, we'll split the bill.
He's in Shenzi's face, trying to get her attention:
ED:
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uhSHENZI:
to Ed
What???
Banzi sees the fleeing trio.
BANZAI:
Hey! Did we order this dinner to go?
SHENZI:
No. Why?
BANZAI:
'Cause there it goes!
Sure enough, our three are some distance away, beating a hasty retreat.
SHENZI:
Get 'em!
The hyenas chase their dinner.
WITH THE CUBS racing from their pursuers. Simba notices Zazu isn't with
them.
NALA:
Page 29/100
Did we lose 'em?
SIMBA:
Where's Zazu?
WITH THE HYENAS:
LAUGHING, holding Zazu by his wings, like he's a puppet marching toward a
thermal vent:
BANZAI:
So the little majordomo bird hippity-hopped all the way to the birdie
boiler.
ZAZU:
panicked
Oh, no! Not the birdie boiler!
ZOOM! A plume of steam LAUNCHES Zazu out of frame. He screams:
ZAZU:
Aaaaaaa!
SHENZI:
Bye-bye, birdie!
HYENAS:
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Simba calls to them:
SIMBA:
Why don't you pick fen somebody your own size!
SHENZI:
Great idea!
[ALTS:
SIMBA:
Oops!
WITH SIMBA AND NALA
Running.
A THERMAL VENT:
shoots up like a curtain. The cubs put on the brakes. Then the hyena trio
appears.
Page 30/100
SHENZI/BANZAI/ED (TOGETHER)
Boo!
The cubs scramble away, running toward:
A HUGE ELEPHANT SKULL
They scale it. It is very slippery. They can't get footing. The cubs fall
off and slide, down in a long, long, long spine that hangs down a steep
incline.
SIMBA/NALA
screaming
Aaaaaaaa!
THE CUBS land in a bone pile. They dash up a hill covered in bones.
TOP OF HILL:
Nala slips. She can't gain her footing. She panics.
NALA:
Simba! Help me!
SIMBA runs and SWIPES SHENZI. She sees red and YOWLS:
SHENZI:
Owww!
She chases after Simba.
THE CUBS race along. Their path is blocked:
ANGLE - A DEAD END
The cubs' only option is to climb an elephant carcass. As they do, the dry
bones give way. Simba and Nala fall. The rib cage SNAPS DOWN, imprisoning
them behind bone bars.
The Hyenas menace toward them, LAUGHING. Simba and Nala tremble in fear.
BANZAI:
wild laugh
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-hathen;coldly
Here, kitty-kitty-kitty --
Simba musters all his courage and tries to roar. All that comes out is a
pathetic squeak.
SIMBA:
rr-rr--?
SHENZI:
mocking
That was it?
laughing
Page 31/100
Ah-ha-ha-ha. Do it again! Come on.
The hyenas LAUGH menacingly. Simba tries desperately to roar again, but all
that comes out is:
SIMBA:
rrr --
His meek little ’rrr" suddenly EXPLODES in an O.S.:
A LION'S VOICE (O.S.)
ROAR!
The Hyenas freeze.
SHENZI & BANZAI
Huh?
WHAM! A huge lion paw sweeps INTO FRAME, sending the hyenas flying. Reveal
Mufasa. The hyenas cower.
SHENZI:
Ow! Hey! Ouch!
BANZAI:
Hey! Ow! Oh! Ouch! Stop! Please!
MUFASA:
Silence!

SHENZI:

Did you know that?
BANZAI:
Me? No. Did you?
SHENZI:
exasperated
No. Of course not.
They both turn to Ed:
BANZAI/SHENZI (TOGETHER)
Ed?
Ed nods "yes" and WE HEAR:
Page 32/100
SFX:
MUFASA:
ROAR!
BANZAI:
Toodles!
The Hyenas run off, YIP-YIP-YIP-YIPPING.
SIMBA:
Dad -- I --
MUFASA:
You deliberately disobeyed me!
SIMBA:
Dad, I'm -- I'm sorry.
MUFASA:
fuming
Let's go hone.
Mufasa leads the way, Zazu flapping behind him. PAN TO REVEAL: Simba
following, hangdog. Nala is with him and shoots him an "It's okay" look,
adding:
NALA:
whispered
I thought you were very brave.
He just continues on, his head drooped.
ANGLE - A ROCKY LEDGE ABOVE THEM
Reveal Scar's shadow. He's taking this all in. It turns away and slinks out
of frame.
SEQ. 6 (SIMBA & PAD)
EXT. PRIDE LANDS - SUNSET
Mufasa walks ahead, leading Simba, Zazu and Nala hone. Simba has a dejected
look as he tries to keep up.
MUFASA (O.S.)
sternly
Zazu!
Zazu flaps forward to the king.

ZAZU:
Sire, I feel simply awful about this --

It wasn't your fault.

MUFASA:
I said, it wasn't your fault.
ZAZU:
taken aback
Oh. Well. Yes. Of course.
MUFASA:
Zazu! Take-Nala home. I have to teach my sot a lesson.
SIMBA hears this and sinks into the grass.
WITH ZAZU AND MUFASA
ZAZU:
Very good, Sire.
Zazu nods and flies to the cubs.
WITH ZAZU AND THE CUBS
ZAZU:

Simba --
Very stiff-upper-lip:
ZAZU:
RAF Commander
Good luck.
Zazu and Nala take off. Simba doesn't move.
MUFASA:
calling
Simba!
SIMBA edging closer to his father. His little paw lands in one of the
enormous paw prints Mufasa left. His is dwarfed by Mufasa's immense print.
WITH SIMBA AND MUFASA
Page 34/100
Simba sits beside his dad.
MUFASA:
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.
SIMBA:
I know. I'm sorry.
MUFASA:
sternly
You could have been killed! And what's worse, you put Nala in danger!
Mufasa turns to see the little cub cowering in fear. Simba starts to cry as
he speaks:
SIMBA:
I was just trying to be brave, like you.
MUFASA:
I'm only brave when I have to be. Simba --
softening
being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.
SIMBA:
But you're not scared of anything.
MUFASA:
I was today.
SIMBA:
You were?
MUFASA:
Yes. I thought I might lose you.
SIMBA:
Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?
Mufasa pulls Simba close.
MUFASA:
C'mere, you.
Then he starts to tickle his cub. Both romp, LAUGHING and GROWLING
playfully.
MUFASA/SIMBA
Ha-ha-ha -- grfff -- ha-ha --
Page 35/100
They stop. There is a moment:
SIMBA:
Dad?
MUFASA:
Hmm?
SIMBA:
We're pals, right.
MUFASA:
Right.
SIMBA:
And we'll always be together. Right?
MUFASA:
Simba, let me tell you something my father told me: Look at the stairs.
Simba looks up.
MUFASA:
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
SIMBA:
Really?
MUFASA:
Yes. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always
be there to guide you.

And so will I.
They stare at the stars in silence, dwarfed by the infinity that surrounds
them.

Oh, man. That lousy Mufasa. I won't be able to sit for a week.
Ed LAUGHS wildly.
ED (O.S.)
Hee-hee-hee!
WITH SHENZI, BANZAI AND ED
still licking their wounds but Ed LAUGHS. Banzai rubs his butt.
Page 36/100
BANZAI:
It's not funny, Ed.
Ed LAUGHS even harder.
ED:
HEE-HEE-HEE.
BANZAI:
Hey, shut up!
Ed is HYSTERICAL.
ED:
HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!
Banzai pounces on him, and they fight.
MISC. GRUMBLING, GROWLING, GNASHING OF TEETH.
SHENZI:
Banzai, will you guys knock it off?
They stop fighting. Ed idiotically chews his own leg. Saliva hangs from
Banzai's jaw.
BANZAI:
He started it.
SHENZI:
Look at you guys! No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.
BANZAI:
Oh, man, I hate dangling.
SHENZI:
Yeah. If it weren't for those lions, we'd be running the joint.
BANZAI:
Nan, I hate lions.
SHENZI:
They're pushy.
BANZAI:
And hairy.
SHENZI:
And stinky.

Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.

Oh, Scar. It's just you.
SHENZI:

Yeah, we were afraid it was somebody important.
SCAR:
coldly
I see.
BANZAI:
You know, Like Mufasa.
SCAR:

"Mufasa-Mufasa-Mufasa!"
Shenzi goes wild, gleefully SHUDDERING and SHIVERING:
SHENZI:
Burrrrr-burrrr-burrrr. It just tingles me!
Ed laughs louder.
SCAR:
under his breath
I an surrounded by idiots.
BANZAI:
Now you. Scar -- You're one of us. You're our pal.
SCAR:
with loathing
Charmed.
SHENZI:
Ooh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.
BANZAI:
Hey, did'ja bring us anything to eat, Scar old buddy, old pal?
Did'ja-did'ja-did'ja?
Scar considers what to do with the scrap of carrion he's carryin'.
SCAR:
I don't think you really deserve this. I practically gift-wrapped those
Page 39/100
cubs for you, and you couldn't even dispose of them.
He tosses them the hunk of meat. They dive into it, voraciously. SOUNDS OF
CHEWING, MUNCHING, SLURPING. They speak with their mouths full.
SHENZI:
Well, ya know, it wasn't like they was exactly alone. Scar.
BANZAI:
Yeah, what were we supposed to do, kill Mufasa?
SCAR:

Precisely.
The hyenas just keep on eating. More SOUNDS OF their CHEWING, MUNCHING,
SLURPING. As --
SONG:
Scar jumps down, scattering hyenas as he lands. He walks through the steam
vents.
SCAR:
I KNOW THAT YOUR POWERS OF RETENTION
He circles Ed and whacks the bone out of his mouth. Ed stands at attention.
Scar continues circling Ed.
SCAR:
ARE AS WET AS A WARTHOG'S BACKSIDE BUT THICK AS YOU ARE, PAY ATTENTION MY
WORDS ARE A MATTER OF PRIDE
Scar waves his paw in front of Ed's glazed-over eyes.
SCAR:
IT'S CLEAR FROM YOUR VACANT
EXPRESSIONS:
THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ALL ON UPSTAIRS
Two hyenas stare down from a ledge and share a joke.
SCAR:
BUT WE'RE TALKING KINGS AND SUCCESSIONS EVEN YOU CAN'T BE CAUGHT UNAWARES
Scar startles the bejesus out of the two hyenas who fall down and land on
steam vents. Scar exits and the steam vents erupt, sending the hyenas into
orbit. Then back into frame.
Scar appears in frame and dances up a ramp.
Page 40/100
SCAR:
SO PREPARE FOR THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME BE PREPARED FOR SENSATIONAL NEWS A
SHINING NEW ERA IS TIPTOEING NEARER
He tiptoes to a higher level. Shenzi asks:
SHENZI:
And where do we feature?
He pinches her cheek.
SCAR:
Just listen to teacher I KNOW IT SOUNDS SORDID BUT YOU'LL BE REWARDED WHEN
AT LAST I AM GIVEN MY DUES! AND INJUSTICE DELICIOUSLY SQUARED BE PREPARED!
He mounts to a higher level, kicking bone-chewing Ed, who bumbles down the
rocks and crashes in a bone pile.
BANZAI:
Yeah! Be prepared. We',11 be prepared!
confused
For what?
Scar sits on a rock pinnacle.
SCAR:
For the death of the King.
BANZAI:
Is he sick?
SCAR:
throttling him
No, fool! We are going to kill him. And Simba, too.
He drops Banzai, who falls out of frame and back into frame between Shenzi
and Ed.
SHENZI:
Great idea! Who needs a king?
ALL HYENAS:
chanting
NO KING, NO KING! LA LA LA LA LA!
The-hyenas dance around and sing like idiotic children. Scar is on a ledge
above them.
SCAR:
Idiots! There will be a King!
Page 41/100
BANZAI:
But you said --
SCAR:
I will be King! Stick with me and you'll never go hungry again!
Scar towers over a gathering throng of hyenas.
BANZAI & SHENZI
Yay, all right! Long live the King!!
Hyena CHEERING, steam fills the screen.
ALL HYENAS:
laughing
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
The steam evaporates, revealing rows of jackbooted, goose stepping storm
trooper hyenas.
Scar observes from above. Their shadows cross his face.

THE FUTURE IS LITTERED WITH PRIZES AND THOUGH I'M THE MAIN ADDRESSEE THE
POINT THAT I MUST EMPHASIZE IS
Leaping into the midst of the hyenas.
SCAR:
YOU WON'T GET A SNIFF WITHOUT ME!
The ground begins to crack open.
SCAR & SHENZI & BANZAI
SO PREPARE FOR THE COUP OF THE CENTURY
More steam vents shoot up as the earth shakes and splits. Scar leaps onto a
pillar of, rock, which begins to rise.
SCAR:
BE PREPARED FOR THE MURKIEST SCAM METICULOUS PLANNING TENACITY, SPANNING
DECADES OF DENIAL IS SIMPLY WHY I'LL BE KING UNDISPUTED RESPECTED, SALUTED
AND SEEN FOR THE WONDER I AM
HYENAS:
Page 42/100
OOOOOO, LA-LA-LA! WE'LL HAVE FOOD! LOTS OF FOOD WE REPEAT ENDLESS MEAT
AAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAH!
While Scar and his pillar of rock continues to thrust up out of the
surrounding ground, the hyenas dance demonically.
SCAR:
YES MY TEETH AND AMBITIONS ARE BARED
BE PREPARED!
SCAR & HYENAS
YES OUR TEETH AND AMBITIONS ARE BARED BE PREPARED!
Hyenas dance and dismember skeletons. One hyena plays the vibes on a rib
cage.
On Scar's evil laugh, we pull back, through the length of a rib cage, and
see him ranting atop his pillar, high above the whole, lurid, Hieronymus
Bosch carnival-in-hell.
SEQ. 10 (STAMPEDE/MUFASA'S DEATH)
EXT. PLATEAU - THE FOLLOWING DAY
Two dots are down below in a tremendous gorge.
SCAR (O.S.)
Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.
SIMBA (O.S.)
What is it?
EXT. FLOOR OF THE GORGE - A SHORT TIME LATER
Scar is with Simba under a tree. Simba sits on a rock.
SCAR:
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it?
SIMBA:
sweetly shrewd
If you tell me — I'll still act surprised.
SCAR:
tsk-tsk-tsking
You are such a naughty boy.
SIMBA:
man-to-man
Come on, Uncle Scar --
SCAR:
No-no-no. This is just for you and your dad. You know, a sort of father-son
thing.
Page 43/100
SCAR:
a real pal
Well, I'd better go get him.
SIMBA:
I'll go with you!
SCAR:
No!
sweetly
No, no.
Scar starts to go.
SCAR:
Just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like
you did with the hyenas.
SIMBA:
You know about that?
SCAR:
Simba -- everyone knows about that.
Simba looks mortified.
SIMBA:
Really?
SCAR:
SCAR:
a beat
Now be a good lad and prove you can do one thing right: Stay on this rock
and wait for your surprise.
SIMBA:
Right!
Scar starts to leave. Simba calls:
SIMBA:
Hey, Uncle Scar, will I like the surprise?
Scar turns back to Simba.
SCAR:
Page 44/100
Simba, it's to die for.
Scar trots off. Simba centers himself on the rock, looks around for his
father. He waits.
EXT. A LEDGE ABOVE - CONTINUOUS
A herd of hundreds of WILDEBEEST grazes- Thru their legs we see Shenzi,
Banzai and Ed.
We hear a stomach RUMBLE.
WITH THE HYENA TRIO
Shenzi glares at Banzai.
SHENZI:
Shut Up!
BANZAI:
I can't help it. I'm so hungry -- I gotta have a wildebeest.
SHENZI:
Stay put.
BANZAI:
Can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?
SHENZI:
No! We wait for the signal from Scar .
WITH SIMBA - CONTINUOUS
A chameleon enters frame left, crawling on a long branch. The chameleon's
weird eye movement catches Simba's attention. They eye each other. As the
chameleon climbs from the branch onto the rock, Simba reaches for it. He
misses the chameleon and gets hit with the branch. The chameleon moves
across a black part of the rock and turns black. Simba steps off the rock.
He holds a leaf over the funny creature which makes it turn green. Simba
LAUGHS.
ANGLE - SCAR
giving the signal.
WITH THE HYENAS:
SHENZI:
Look! There he is! Let's go.
They slink toward the grazing wildebeest.
WITH SIMBA:
He holds his paw near the chameleon, who changes color as it crawls up
Simba's arm. It nears Simba's face and bites him on the nose. He recoils,
Page 45/100
YELPING:
SIMBA:
Yeee-owwww!
SOUND:
THUNDERING of hundreds of wildebeest approaching.
ANGLE - TOP OF THE GORGE
WILDEBEEST cascade down into the gorge, running directly toward Simba.
WITH SIMBA:
Simba sees the WILDEBEEST flood down into the gorge, a STAMPEDE that
thunders directly toward him.
Simba runs for his life.
WITH THE STAMPEDE
The Hyena Trio nips at the hooves of the Wildebeest as the final group
approaches the edge of the ridge and spills put of sight over and down into
the gorge.
WITH SIMBA:
running deeper into the gorge.
EXT. TOP OF GORGE - ANOTHER VANTAGE POINT - CONTINUOUS
Zazu, riding along on Mufasa's back^. notices dust rising from below in the
gorge.
ZAZU:
Look, Sire! The herd is on the move.
MUFASA:
Odd --
Scar emerges from the bluff below, calling to his brother:
SCAR:
Mufasa! Quick! Stampede! In the gorge! Simba's down there!
MUFASA:
Simba?
WITH SIMBA:
Running full out. Barely ahead of the wildebeest. Simba scurries up to the
branch of a dead tree.
WITH MUFASA, ZAZU AND SCAR
ZAZU:
Page 46/100
I'll fly ahead, Sire!
ZAZU'S POV - FLYING
looking down, over the herd, he sees Simba clinging to a branch. Simba
frantically calls:
SIMBA:
Zazu! Help me!
ZAZU:
Your father is on the way! Hold on!
SIMBA:
Hurry!
WITH MUFASA AND SCAR
They leap down onto a lower ledge. Zazu zooms in, directing Mufasa's
attention toward Simba.
ZAZU:
There! On that tree.
MUFASA:
calling
Hold on, Simba!
WITH SIMBA:
The branch he's clinging to starts to give way. It dips.
SIMBA:
Aaaaah!
Simba tries more desperately to hold on.
WITH MUFASA:
WE TRUCK with Mufasa as he plunges into the gorge and battles his way
upstream through the oncoming wildebeest.
WITH ZAZU AND SCAR
From their vantage above the gorge. Zazu hovers.
ZAZU:
Scar, this is awful! I'll go back for help.
Scar BATS Zazu against a rock. SPLAT! Zazu's out cold.
ZAZU:
Uuumph!
ANGLE - SIMBA
Page 47/100
as a wildebeest CRASHES into the branch he clings to. Simba flips into the
air.
MUFASA leaps in and catches his son. Mufasa carries Simba and runs. A
wildebeest hits him, and Simba tumbles out of Mufasa's mouth, into the
midst of the herd.
SIMBA dodges wildebeest. Mufasa races in and pulls Simba out.
FULL SHOT:
Mufasa runs and places Simba on a ledge above the trouble.
Simba is safe. But a wildebeest knocks Mufasa back into the flow. Mufasa
disappears under the army of galloping wildebeest.
MUFASA:
Ahhh! Ohhh!
SIMBA:
Dad!
Mufasa is out of Simba's view, so he does.not witness the following:
WITH THE STAMPEDE
Mortally wounded, Mufasa makes a valiant leap up a steep incline. He climbs
up loose rock that gives way. He struggles up the incline and climbs just
beneath a rocky overhang. He digs his claws in and dangles.
ANGLE - SCAR
looking down at his brother, who clings for his life.
MUFASA:
Calls to Scar:
MUFASA:
Scar, help me! Brother -- help me?
SCAR AND MUFASA:
Unmoved, Scar glares at Mufasa. Hold a beat. Then Scar DIGS his claws into
Mufasa's forearms, pulls him closer and whispers:
SCAR:
Long live the King.
Scar releases his grip. Mufasa slides down the steep incline to his death.
SIMBA runs over the rise JUST IN TIME TO SEE Mufasa disappear into the
thundering wildebeest. He does not see Scar. He cries:
SIMBA:
Noooooooo!
Page 48/100
Simba runs down into the dust-filled gorge.
IN THE GORGE:
Still choked with dust kicked up by the stampede. Simba searches for his
father.
SIMBA:
Dad!?
He hears a SOUND and turns to look:
SIMBA:
Dad?
But it is only a stray Wildebeest that runs off. Its movement draws Simba's
gaze to the form of his lifeless father.
ANGLE - MUFASA
Simba rushes to his father.
He nuzzles him.
SIMBA:
panic building
Dad?
Nothing. Again.
SIMBA:
sore panic
Dad? Cone on.
He tries to raise Mufasa's powerful am. It flops to the ground. Panicked,
Simba runs away a few paces.

Dad, you gotta get up. Come on, Dad, stop playing. Dad, we gotta go home.

SCAR:
Of course you didn't, No one ever means for these things to happen. But the

your mother think?
Simba sobs harder.

TIMON:
Pumbaa, I don't wonder. I know.
PUMBAA:
Oh. What are they?
TIMON:
They're fireflies. Fireflies that got stuck up on that big bluish black
thing.
PUMBAA:
Oh, gee, I always thought they were balls of gas, burning billions of miles
away.
TIMON:
Pumbaa, with you everything's gas.
PUMBAA:
Simba, what do you think?

SIMBA:
Are you really there?
There is no response. He SIGHS and then tries to block it all out with his
"mantra:"
SIMBA:

He flops down. The force of the impact sends milkweed airborne across the
night sky.

RAFIKI the wise old baboon we net at Simba's Presentation sits in the
branch of a tree. He clutches what he's just caught and dives down into the
tree.
INT. RAFIKI'S CAVE - CONTINUOUS
Rafiki takes a hollow tortoise shell and tosses in what he just collected.
He cracks open a gourd. As he "reads" the contents, he idly takes a bite
out of one half of the gourd.
He takes a good long look at the contents of the shell, MUMBLES and then
LAUGHS.

RAFIKI:
Simba!
He goes to a painting of a lion cub that has the same marking on his
forehead that Rafiki placed on Simba at his Presentation.
RAFIKI:
Simba --
He scurries to get his walking stick. Then he returns to the wall painting
and smears something from one of his gourds around the head of the cub. Now
the cub has a mane. Rafiki laughs joyfully.
RAFIKI:
It's time.
He grabs his walking stick and runs out.

PUMBAA:

It lands on a tree stump. Pumbaa quickly hides behind a tree. Then he
cautiously stalks the bug and gets stuck over the stump. He hears a CRACK
in the distance. He listens, then calls:
PUMBAA:
Timon?
There is no response, so he resumes his bug hunt. He comes eye to eye with
the bug.
PUMBAA'S POV
Rack Focus to reveal:

Timon SEES the Lioness leaping for them. He freezes, screaming:
TIMON:

As the Lioness leaps, Simba (now an adolescent) jumps into frame and knocks
her down. Timon takes a peek and sees the lions face off.
TIMON:

Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you. Everything's gonna be okay.
PUMBAA:
Hey, what's happenin'?

With that, Nala flips Simba on his back and pins him to the ground, the
same way she did as a cub. She holds Simba there a beat. Simba thinks he
recognizes her.
SIMBA:
Nala?
Nala backs away in fear/shock.

SIMBA:

She steps back, unsure.
NALA:

Simba gives her a reassuring smile. Nala realizes it is Simba and screams

SIMBA:
Relax, Timon.
There is a moment.
NALA:
Wait 'til everyone finds out you've been here all this time! And your
mother! What will she think?
Simba looks panic-stricken.
SIMBA:
Page 70/100
She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know.
NALA:
Of course they do! Everyone thinks you're dead.
SIMBA:
They do?
NALA:
Yes. Scar told us about the stampede.
SIMBA:
cagey/suspicious
What else did he tell you?
NALA:
What else matters? You're alive! And that means --
oh, my God
you're the king!
Simba is taken aback. Timon leaps up:
TIMON:
"King?"
"oh, go on"
Pfffff! Lady, have you got your lions crossed!
NALA:
No, he is the rightful king.
Pumbaa believes and is in awe. He moves respectfully toward Simba.
PUMBAA:
The king! Your Majesty --
Pumbaa bows reverently and kisses Simba's paw.

upbeat
Look. Things change. I'm finished with all that. I don't think about it any
more.
TIMON:
Let me get this straight. You're the king and you never told us?
SIMBA:
Remember, Timon, "Put your past behind you?"
TIMON:
Well this is different!
SIMBA:
Look, Timon. I'm still the sane guy.
TIMON:
But with power!

Come on, Timon. After all, he is the king.
TIMON:
And what are we? The short subjects!
WITH SIMBA AND NALA - CONTINUOUS
Simba looks at the duo exiting, commenting:
SIMBA:
Timon and Pumbaa -- You'll learn to love 'em.
The reality of the situation finally hits Nala. She looks at Simba, and her
eyes well up with tears. Simba has never dealt with anything like this; so
he isn't sure of what to do.
SIMBA:
What? What is it?
NALA:
It's like you're back from the dead. You don't know how much this could
mean to everyone -- what it means to me.
Overcome with emotion, Nala turns-away, embarrassed by her tears. Now Simba
is at even more of a loss.
SIMBA:
Hey, it's okay.
NALA:
then:
I've really missed you.
SIMBA:
I've missed you, too.
There is a moment between them.

Isn't this a great place? Nala, you're gonna love it here.
NALA:
It is beautiful --
a beat
Page 75/100
But I don't understand something. You've been alive all this time. Why
didn't you come back to Pride Rock?
SIMBA:
very casual
Well, I just needed to get out on my own -- live my own life. And I did!
And it's great!
NALA:
We've really needed you at home.
SIMBA:
No one needs me.
NALA:
Yes we do. You're the king.
SIMBA:
Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the king. Scar is.
NALA:
Simba, he let the hyenas take over "the Pride lands.
SIMBA:
genuine
What?
NALA:
I didn't know how to tell you. Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no
water. Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.
SIMBA:
I can't go back.
Simba starts to exit. Nala goes to him.
NALA:
Why?
SIMBA:
You wouldn't understand.
NALA:
What wouldn't I understand?
Page 76/100
SIMBA:
No, no, no -- It doesn't matter. Hakuna Matata.
NALA:
What?
SIMBA:
Hakuna Matata. It's what I learned out here. Sometimes bad things happen.
NALA:

Simba --
SIMBA:

and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry?
Simba turns away from Nala.
NALA:
Because it's your responsibility!
a beat
Simba, doesn't the Pride mean anything to you? Doesn't your mother mean
anything to you?
He turns to her:
SIMBA:
What about you? You left.
NALA:
I left to find help. And I found you! Don't you understand? You're our only
hope.
SIMBA:
Sorry.
NALA:
What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember.
SIMBA:
You're right. I'm not. Now are you satisfied?
NALA:
No. Just disappointed.
Page 77/100
SIMBA:
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.
NALA:
Good. At least one of us does.
SIMBA:
Listen! You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life? You
don't even know what I've been through.
Simba turns and leaves. Infuriated, Nala calls:
NALA:
Then tell me!
SEQ. 16 ("TO BE OR NOT TO BE"/REFLECTING POOL/MUFASA'S GHOST)
EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT - A SHORT TIME LATER
Lost in thought, Simba sits on a rock and stares up at the twinkling sky.
SIMBA:
I don't care what anybody says. I won't go back. What would it prove,
anyway? It won't change anything -- You can't change the past.
re stars
You told me you'd always be there for me -- but you're not. There's nothing
out there. There's nothing to believe in anymore. Nothing. Nothing.
He sits quietly. He is interrupted by an odd little tune.
RAFIKI'S VOICE
singing
Up in a nearby tree, he sees the silhouette of a figure - whose angles
match those of the gnarled branches. Simba moves away in search of
solitude.
EXT. FALLEN TRUNK - MOMENTS LATER
Simba rests on a fallen tree trunk that bridges a stream which reflects the
stars and Simba's melancholy look.
SIMBA:
Sigh--
PLOP! a stone lands in the water below. Then:
RAFIKI'S VOICE
singing
Simba calls up.
SIMBA:
Page 78/100
Come on! Will ya cut it out?
Simba walks away again. Rafiki follows.
RAFIKI:
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!
SIMBA:
Would you stop following me?
Rafiki continues to shadow him.
SIMBA:
Who are you?
Rafiki cones right up to Simba.
RAFIKI:
The question is:
Simba thinks a moment.
SIMBA:
a sigh, then:
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.
RAFIKI:
I know who you are. Shhh -- Come here. It's a secret.
Simba leans his ear toward Rafiki.
RAFIKI:
singing
While Rafiki continues singing:
SIMBA:
Enough already!

What is that supposed to mean, anyway?
RAFIKI:
It means you're a baboon, and I'm not!
laughing
Hee-hee-hee.
SIMBA:
Page 79/100
I think you're a little confused.
Simba begins to exit. Rafiki's finger pokes Simba in the nose.
RAFIKI:
Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused. You don't even know who you are.
SIMBA:
And I suppose you know?
RAFIKI:
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy. Bye.
Simba is in shock. Rafiki scoots away. Simba chases after him.
SIMBA:
Hey! Wait!
LONG SHOT - PLAINS
Simba's silhouetted form races up the hill.
EXT. HILL TOP - LATER
Rafiki sits calmly, guru-style on the top of a hill. Huffing and puffing,
Simba finishes his climb up to Rafiki.
SIMBA:
You knew my father?
RAFIKI:
Correction. I know your father.
SIMBA:
I hate to tell you this, but my father died a long tine ago.
RAFIKI:
Nope. Wrong again.
Rafiki walks toward thick jungle underbrush, calling back to Simba,
RAFIKI:
He's alive! I'll show him to you. You follow old Rafiki. He knows the way.
Rafiki disappears through a small opening of a bower. Simba goes over and
looks in. He considers a moment, then disappears inside.
INT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
Dark, dense foliage. Simba tries to keep up with agile, fast-moving Rafiki
who calls back:
RAFIKI:
Hurry up! Don't dawdle! Mufasa's waiting!
Page 80/100
Rafiki dashes through the trees, hanging branches and vines. Simba has a
hard time following.
SIMBA:
Hey! Whoa! Wait! Wait a second! Would you slow down!
RAFIKI:
Come on-come on!
ASANTE SANA. SQUASH BANANA. WE WE NUGU. MI MI APANA.
SIMBA:
Wait. Will you wait? Wait a second.
Rafiki seems to be gone. Simba presses on through the thick underbrush. He
looks up and sees Rafiki in a tree. Then Rafiki is gone. Baffled, Simba
continues on until:
Rafiki's hand pushes up in Simba's face.
RAFIKI:
Stop!
Rafiki approaches a curtain of tall reeds. He parts them, directing Simba:
RAFIKI:
Shhhh -- Look down there.
EXT. REFLECTING POOL - NIGHT
Simba anxiously, cautiously looks in a pool of water. He sees the
REFLECTION OF A LION.
SIMBA:
That's not my father. It's just my reflection.
RAFIKI:
No --
Rafiki directs Simha's line of vision.
RAFIKI:
Look harder --
ANGLE - REFLECTING POOL
The lion reflection changes to a reflection of Mufasa's image. Simba gasps.
RAFIKI:
You see -- He lives in you.
MUFASA:
Simba --
Page 81/100
Simba looks up to see where the Voice is coning from. He knows it belongs
to his dad. Something magical starts to happen: The image of Mufasa begins
to build itself. At first it is frightening.
SIMBA:
Father?
MUFASA:
Simba, have you forgotten me?
SIMBA:
No! How could I?
The ghost's presence starts to become the atmosphere - big, colorful, full
of magic light.
MUFASA:
You have forgotten who you are, and so, have forgotten me.
The vision becomes more warn and loving.
MUFASA:
Look inside yourself, Simba. You are sore than what you have become. You
must take your place in the Circle of Life.
We are now comfortable with the image.
SIMBA:
How can I go back. I'm not who I used to be.
MUFASA:
Remember who you are -- You are my son and the one true king.
The vision starts to fade.
MUFASA:
Remember who you are --
fade --
SIMBA:
No! Please! Don't leave me!
fade --
MUFASA:
Remember --
fade --
SIMBA:

PUMBAA:
Timon, there comes a time in life - when one must take fate into one's own

meet my destiny, as his faithful friend.
Pumbaa exits. Timon thinks a beat, then rants;

Two hyenas in f.g. fight over a bone. One of them flies against the rock.
Simba, Nala, Timon and Pumbaa peek put, surveying the area. Timon is having
second thoughts.
TIMON:
Jeeze, look at all those -- teeth. Are you sure this is such a good idea?
The hyena gets up. Everybody ducks behind the rock but Timon. Simba's paw
POPS UP into frame and pushes Timon down behind the rock, just as the hyena
looks up. The hyena exits.
The quartet's heads pop up.
TIMON:
Maybe we should try this tomorrow.

animal rib cage, PATHETICALLY SINGS.
ZAZU:
singing
NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE I'VE SEEN NOBODY KNOWS MY SORROW
SCAR:
Oh, Zazu, lighten up. Sing something with a little bounce in it!
Zazu looks miffed, then finally gives it the old college try, but without
much conviction.
ZAZU:
singing
IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL
IT'S A SMALL

No! Anything but that!
Zazu starts again, deadpan.

Okay, my roley-poley buddy, I say it's time we turn into FAST FOOD!
And they run off, pursued by the hyenas.
WITH SIMBA as he hears:
SCAR (O.S.)
calling
SA—RAAA-BIIII!!!!!!!!!!!
SCAR'S ECHO
Sarabi-Sarabi-Sarabi!!!
SIMBA'S POV
Of Sarabi walking the gauntlet from the back of the crowd to the front,
head held high. Nobody moves. The hyenas stare at her ominously. An eerie
wind WHOOOSHES across the plain.
WITH SCAR AND SARABI
The wind whips Scar's mane. Lightning strikes in the distance.
SARABI:
Yes, Scar?
SCAR:
Where is your hunting party? They're not doing their job.
SARABI:
Page 92/100
Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.
SCAR:
No! They're just not looking hard enough.
SARABI:
It's over, Scar. There is nothing left. We have only one choice. We must
leave Pride Rock.
SCAR:
We're not going anywhere.
SARABI:
Then you are sentencing us to death.
SCAR:
Then so be it.
SARABI:
You can't do that.
SCAR:
I am the king, and I can do whatever I want!
SARABI:
If you were half the king Mufasa was, you would never do --
SCAR:
I AM TEN TIMES THE KING MUFASA WAS!
Scar strikes Sarabi, and she falls.
SCAR'S ECHO
Mufasa-Mufasa-Mufasa --
Heat lightning flashes. The thunder becomes a ROAR.
SEQ. 19 (THE FIGHT)
EXT. PRIDE ROCK - DUSK
The ROAR continues. Heat lightning illuminates the shadowy FIGURE of a
LION. It is Simba, who has witnessed Scar's treachery. Simba charges down
the rock.
SCAR skitters away in fear:
SCAR:
Mufasa? -- No! -- It can't be. You're dead! Go away. Go! Leave me alone!
Simba stands near his mother. Sarabi lifts her head, unsure of who the
stranger is.

SARABI:

No. It's me.

ANGLE - SHENZI, BANZAI & ED
HYENA TRIO:
Gulp!
And they duck behind a rock.
WITH SIMBA AND SCAR
Simba silently stalks Scar, who backs away. Scar tries to hold him off:
SCAR:
Stroke of bad timing your showing up when you did.
SIMBA:
I'd say I'm right on time.
Simba lunges at Scar. They tussle. Scar gets away.
SCAR:
Oh, Simba -- You must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom --
SIMBA:
interrupting
Are no longer yours.
Simba leaps for him again.
Page 94/100
SIMBA:
Step down, Scar.
SCAR:
patronizing
Oh. Well, I would, of course. But there is one little problem.
WE HEAR eerie laughter of the hyenas.
HYENAS (O.S.)
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

TONS OF HYENAS rush in, LAUGHING violently. They are all over Simba, who
desperately tries to fight them off.
ANGLE - SARABI
SARABI:
Simba!
SURROUNDING FLATLAND - CONTINUOUS
Lightning strikes closer to Pride Rock, igniting the land.
WITH SCAR AND SIMBA
The hyenas pulverize Simba. Scar finally shouts an order:
SCAR:
Enough!
The hyenas immediately stop and part down the center.
Scar cooly walks through the parted crowd, toward Simba, who is weakened by
his injuries and dangerously near the edge of the promontory. Simba
struggles to keep from sliding off the rock to his death. Loose stones give
way, causing him more trouble. Scar looms in for the kill.
SCAR:
Poor pathetic Simba. Ever since you were a cub, wherever you went, disaster
followed.
SIMBA:
Step down. Scar.
SCAR:
Always rushing headlong into trouble -- But "Daddy" was always there to
save you. As I recall, "Daddy" died trying to save you.
SIMBA:
It was an accident.
Page 95/100
SCAR:
And that's why you ran away?
to Sarabi
Not very kingly, eh, Sarabi?
SIMBA:
I was wrong.
SCAR:
Simba slips back off the promontory and SCREAMS:
SIMBA:
Aaaaaa!
He dangles off the edge of the rock, his claws losing their hold with each
passing second.
Simba doesn't know it, but he is in the exact sane position his father was
before his death. Scar savors the monent.
SCAR:
Now this looks familiar. Where have I seen this before? Let me'think --
brightening
Oh, yes -- I remember! That's just the way your father looked before I
killed him.
Simba ROARS and leaps for Scar, hitting him like a freight train. They
fight. Simba flips Scar. The hyenas freeze while and Simba holds Scar down:
SIMBA:
You killed him! All this time, I hated myself -- when you're the one who
did it!
Scar calls to his army:
SCAR:
Help me, you idiots!
Scar's legions rally around him. Scar and Simba fight through the crush of
hyenas.
WE HEAR:

He crashes into Zazu's ribcage prison, smashing it, freeing Zazu.
EXT. CAVE - MOMENTS LATER
Banzai runs out with Zazu WILDLY PECKING him. Banzai screams in pain:

Simba looks around the area. There is no sign of Scar.
LIGHTNING FLASH reveals Scar, sneaking up Pride Rock.
SIMBA runs after Scar, through flames and smoke up the steep incline.

Simba emerges from a wall of flame, his mane smoking.

SIMBA:
Murderer!
EXT. TOP OF PRIDE ROCK - DUSK
Scar cowers at the edge of the promontory. Simba stalks him.
ANGLE - SHENZI
Unseen by both Scar and Simba, she creeps up behind then.
ANGLE - SIMBA AND SCAR
Scar tries to calm Simba by being his same old, in-control, manipulative
self.
SCAR:
Simba, you don't understand. It wasn't me. I didn't kill your father. It
was the hyenas. They're evil. They'll stop at nothing. I was outnumbered. I
had to say that.
ANGLE - SHENZI
Reacting to the betrayal. That's it. She's gone.
WITH SIMBA AND SCAR
Simba is neutral. We aren't sure what he thinks about Scar's new
information.
SCAR:
Simba-Simba, they are the enemy, I am your family. Now that you're back --
Together, we can defeat them! We'll start right now! Come, come -- Tell me
-- What shall I do?
Old advice resonates:
SIMBA:
Run away, Scar. Run. Run away and never return.
Simba lets Scar up. Scar starts to slink off.
SCAR:
Yes. Of course. As you wish -- Your -- Majesty.
Scar LUNGES for Simba. Simba moves quickly and flips him with the signature
"Nala flip" -- sending Scar over the edge of Pride Rock.
ANGLE - BASE OF PRIDE ROCK
Scar lands in the smoldering embers. He sees:
ANGLE - PACK OF HYENAS
emerging from the flames, walking toward Scar, YIPING:
HYENAS:
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
SCAR smiles.
Page 98/100
SCAR:

The number of hyenas increases. Their LAUGHTER becomes an eerie/menacing
choir.
HYENAS:
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
THE HYENAS eyes glaring, advance on Scar.
SCAR his eyes widen; his smile melts into a look of horror.
SCAR:
